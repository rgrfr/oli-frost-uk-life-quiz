<h1 align="center"> The Life in the UK Quiz</h1>

This quiz was made to test the street-credibility of Ella, a frequent visitor from the USA, after studying in the UK for several months in 2025. But then, without any agenda we thought to give it a wider audience. Oli F wrote it after taking time off averting a climate crisis - see his work and award-winning work and songs at [olifro.st](http://olifro.st). His dad, Roger F made the app in lovable.dev.
